"""
    Experimental keylogger program (v1.0)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the scope of our cybersecurity training, we were asked to design
    a small keylogger program in Python. Program's objectives are:

        - Collect data typed on user's keyboard
        - Send collected data on a external server
        - Make use of threads for parallel execution
        - The program destroys itself upon completion

    This program specifically targets machines running on Windows.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    This program has been designed for educational purposes only.
    I am NOT responsible for any damage caused by misuse or malicious
    utilization of this program.

    Made with Python 3.13.2
